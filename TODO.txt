TODO:
Make Entity a class so that parenting is easier and not as many classes need a reference to the Scene.
Add json parsing for loading (and saving?) levels
Load LightComponent properly
FIX HACK
Look up wireframe geometry shaders to avoid rendering scene "without lighting"

BUGS:
if window is not focused input can still be accessed

TODO:
Change AssetManager to use assetIDs as ints to allow multiple assets with the same name
Render texture assets to images in IMGUI
Implement asset details
Add Scene states to obtain an undo/redo stack?
Selection state for editor and entities should be the same
Rehaul GUI to use anchor points
Functionality to add or remove custom tags

Restructure entity list for better cache performance
Compile for release should remove all editor features
Break up shaders so that there isn't a "default shadow map"
Make material(asset) creator
Implement "first person" entity moving in debug mode
Make a scene graph or some kind of proper ordering to entities
Convert pointers to smart pointers
Collision detection

BUGS:
Selecting default meshes makes the wireframe selection not work
Some GUI elements can't be disabled?
Soft shadows makes the light brighter
Receive shadows doesn't work
Shortcut keys in Edit mode don't always work the first time.
Wireframe meshes aren't sorted, so they are filled with the clear color.
